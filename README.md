# SC1015: Market Basket Analysis for an E-commerce Store

## Project Overview

Our team conducted a data science project focusing on Market Basket Analysis for an e-commerce store. The primary objective was to recommend products to customers to enhance sales and revenue. During the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase, we identified additional insights related to customer segmentation and inventory management. These findings enabled us to suggest complementary products to customers based on their initial purchases.

## Data Files

To run the entire project, please ensure the following data files are uploaded:

1. `data.csv`
2. `b_customers_data_transactions.csv`
3. `s_customers_data_transactions.csv`
4. `s_ml_data.csv`
5. `b_ml_data.csv`

Due to the large size of these files, they are hosted in a shared folder accessible via the following link:
